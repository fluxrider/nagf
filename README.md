## License

The code in this project is written under various licenses. You will find a LICENSE file in each folder where code resides, as well as simple header comment in each source file. By folders it is as follows:

* demos: Zero Clause BSD
* servers: GNU General Public License 3.0
* libsrr: Mozilla Public License 2.0
* utils: Mozilla Public License 2.0

 In a nutshell, things application need to use (i.e. libsrr, utils) are under a weak copyleft license. Demos are under a permissive license to allow borrowing their code to build your own program. Servers are strong copyleft to foster the sharing of improvements.

### Assets

Fonts have embedded licenses.

Other assets for demos (e.g. images, music, maps) fall under their own licenses. For the most part, you can assume it was made by myself, David Lareau, and licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>. This license prevents their use in commercial product, but aside from that feel free to use them as long as you also give me some form of attribution.

If the filename has multiple extensions (e.g. overworld.CC0.ArMM1998.png), the resource name is followed by the license type then followed by the author (whom in no way endorses this project). In the example, the license is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>, and the author is ArMM1998.
